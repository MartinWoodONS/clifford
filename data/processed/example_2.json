{"text": "Dear Ms. Hillier,In your January 2023 report on ‘Grassroots participation in sport and physical activity’ youasked Sport England to write to you with details of the barriers for the least active groups,and what action we are taking to address these barriers, to ensure that people have themotivation, confidence and opportunity to participate in physical activity. I am pleased tonow share some information here with you.There is significant detail captured below, but there is more still that we have not included,in order to ensure this letter is practicable for the Committee.We will continue to analyse the barriers to activity that exist for different groups, to sharethis insight with our many and varied partners, and to work with those partners to supportpeople across the country to be active in the way that best works for them.Sport England’s latest Active Lives data1, covering the period November 2021 – November2022, provides the most recent national statistics demonstrating the variation of activitylevels across different demographic groups. The adult groups that are least active are:• Women• Older adults• Lower socio-economic groups and those living in the most deprived places (IMD 1-3)• Those with a disability or long-term health condition• Those with an Asian, Black or Other ethnicityThere are three overarching barriers to highlight, before delving into demographic specificbarriers. All three underpin all consumer – and in this case, participant – behaviour.",
