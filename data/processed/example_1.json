{"text": "Dear Dame Meg,I promised to write to you on a question raised at the recent Committee Hearing on SupportedHousing. The Committee asked:‘How are you building in the need to identify supported housing need for individual cohorts, e.g.autistic children living with elderly adults and people with physical disabilities living with elderlycarers?’We are working closely with local authorities (LAs) and sector experts to design the strategic planningguidance for LAs and bodies such as the Care Quality Commission. The plans produced as a result willset out the current local stock of supported housing for each LA, their forecast of future need includingcurrent unmet need, and a delivery plan. Our ambition for the strategic plans is that those who needhousing with care and support will have the choice to live in suitable local provision. We will considerthe specific question of flows of cohorts with different needs into supported housing, such as thoseoutlined by the Committee, recognising that for the whole range of supported housing cohortssupport needs can change and will arise at different points.Sir Geoffrey Clifton-Brown raised a separate issue relating to the supply of supported housing in hisconstituency and promised to send further detail. My officials look forward to receiving thisinformation and looking into the issues described.",
