{"text": "Dear Chair, Active Travel in England I am writing, as a courtesy, to inform you of a development that may be relevant to the Public Accounts Committee hearing into the NAO’s report on Active Travel which is due to take place on 19 July. As you may be aware, a few days after the National Audit Office’s report was published, the Transport Action Network (TAN) sought leave to bring a judicial review of the Secretary of State’s decision of 9 March to reduce the amount of dedicated capital funding for active travel for the years 2023/24 and 2024/25. While I and my fellow Departmental witnesses (Jessica Matthew and Danny Williams) will seek to answer the Committee’s questions as fully as possible, if the judicial review is allowed to proceed, we will need to take advice from Counsel on matters that fall within scope of the legal action. This may mean that we will be unable to respond as fully on the day as we might otherwise have done when it comes to areas of questioning which are directly relevant to the case. I will update the Committee on any changes to the status of the JR application prior to the hearing.",
